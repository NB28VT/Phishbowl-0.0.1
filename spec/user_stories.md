PHANTASY PHOOTBALL

Phantasy Phootball is a game that allows a league of friends to make Phish set
list predictions in a fantasy football-like atmosphere. Users will be able to
select a number of predictions such as set 1 opener, set 2 closer, and others
using a simple interface. The app will query the Phish.net API after a show has
been performed, and award points to each user based on how good their predictions
were. The app will keep track of points over a given tour, and select a winner at the end of a competition.

2. As a poor Phishhead who doesn't have any money to go on tour, I'd like to be
able to automatically have the app check my predictions based on the most
current show.

3. As a nerdy Phishead, I would like to be able to check how long it has been
since Phish played my favorite song.

4. As a social Phishead, I would like to be able add friends to my competition group,
so I can compare my setlist savvy against them.


5. As a bored Phishhead waiting for Phish to go back on tour, I'd like to check
my predictions against a random show given a year.  

6. As a curious Phishead, I would like to be able to see the latest setlist posted when I log in.
